<h1>Stable Diffusion without GUI</h1>

<p>This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file named <code>stablediffusion.ipynb</code>, which demonstrates how to use the Diffusers repository from Hugging Face without a graphical user interface (GUI). The notebook is designed to be run on Google Colab, a free cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that provides access to GPUs and TPUs.</p>

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>stablediffusion.ipynb</code>: Jupyter Notebook file containing the code and documentation for using the Diffusers repository from Hugging Face without GUI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Open the notebook in Google Colab by clicking on the provided link or by uploading it manually.</li>
  <li>Run the cells sequentially, following the instructions and comments provided in the notebook.</li>
  <li>Make sure to install any necessary dependencies by running the appropriate cells or commands.</li>
  <li>Replace the placeholder code or parameters with your own data and configurations as needed.</li>
  <li>Execute the code cells to train, evaluate, or perform other tasks related to using the Diffusers repository from Hugging Face.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Python 3.x</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
  <li>Google Colab (optional but recommended for GPU/TPU support)</li>
  <li>Dependencies listed in the notebook(already mentioned in the code segment no extra headache needed)(installable via <code>pip</code> or <code>conda</code>):</li>
  <ul>
    <li>AutoPipeline</li>
    <li>diffusers</li>
    <li>respective model (loRa optional)[like AbyssOrangeMixv3]</li>
    <!-- Add more dependencies as needed -->
  </ul>
</ul>
